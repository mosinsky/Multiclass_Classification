I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018.

       "11  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

       "      <td>I am writing you to file a complaint about an unresolved issue with my credit card chase and their benefit and travel departments. This has been my second travel related credit issue with chase. My first experience with chase was also about a credit that they were supposed to process. Chase was either unresponsive or slow. I finally ended up contacting the airlines directly and got a much quicker response and resolution from them. \\n\\nMy more recent issue with Chase has been my most stressful and frustrating experience when dealing with any credit card company or for that matter any other company that offers products or services. I am a Chase Sapphire card holder who has been using the card regularly for purchases amounting to hundreds or thousands of dollars every month. I have an excellent payment history with most of the bills paid in full every month. \\n\\n\\nIn XXXX  of 2019, I bought my XXXX airline ticket for an overseas trip through Chase using my accumulated Chase points. My father passed away overseas a week before my trip. I had to cancel my original trip and leave immediately so I called chase to cancel my ticket. Despite, under a lot of stress and in grief, I had to be on the phone with them for hours. I was put on long holds, transferred to different departments and still did not receive a definitive answer about cancelation of my trip and credit to my account. \\n\\n\\nAccording to the last customer representative that I spoke with that night, they had to send an email to a different department and that I could follow up with them the following week by Tuesday or Wednesday as they would have processed my cancelation by then. Unfortunately, It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to be calling from overseas and be on the phone with the credit card company for hours. I had to authorize my husband to follow up on my behalf the following week before his upcoming trip overseas as he had to leave on XX/XX/XXXX, which was our original plan. \\n\\n\\nMy husband called them few times and went through the same process of being on the phone for hours either being on hold or being transferred to different departments. He spoke with the main customer service, the benefits and the chase travel. Initially, a representative advised him to contact XXXX  directly to cancel my ticket. Finally, after further research, the same representative that he spoke to in the benefit department told him that we should expect to receive a credit because of the death in the family, The representative assigned us a case number and told my husband that Chase would get the refund from XXXX on our behalf. According to him, all we needed was a death certificate. Since we were both expected to be out of the country for few weeks, the representative told my husband that the credit could be processed anytime upon our return or soon after the Chase received the death certificate from us. \\n\\nIn XXXX, while still overseas, I received an e-mail on XXXX, XXXX from XXXX in Chase travel who was following up with the death certificate. I e-mailed Chase travel department the scanned copy of the death certificate as soon as it became available to me. I even e-mailed them a translation of the death certificate which was neither required by Chase or XXXX. I sent it to XXXX who had contacted me on XXXX, XXXX by responding to her e-mail from XXXX, XXXX and then forwarded it again to her to make sure that they received it. For personal and family reasons, I ended up staying a little longer than expected and retuned to the United States on XXXX. There was still no acknowledgment from XXXX or anyone from Chase Travel or any other department acknowledging the receipt of my e-mail from XXXX or any other update. Soon after my return, I had to send the travel department my father 's death certificate for the third time and even tried to follow up with a phone call. I also tried to send them an e-mail on XX/XX/XXXX, expressing my disappointment and requesting an update. I also tried to correspond with Chase customer service and Chase travel through my online chase account. \\n\\nChase travel finally responded with an acknowledgement through an e-mail that they had received and located the death certificate that I had sent them. The e-mail was from XXXX, one of the Travel consultant supervisor for chase travel. According to her, they had forwarded the death certificate to XXXX. She apologized for my experience with them and also asked me to disregard any other emails from them requesting documentation. During this whole ordeal with Chase, I had contacted XXXX numerous times and spoke to different representatives. According to XXXX, In order for Chase to process my credit, they didn't need to forward the death certificate to XXXX. \\n\\nIn one of my initials calls to Chase after my return to the United States, I found out that the case number / reference number assigned to us and given to my husband by the by chase benefits department in XXXX could not be used as a reference because I was told that it did not exist in their system. In XXXX and XXXX, I spoke to several people and few supervisors hoping that they could resolve my issue. Customer service agents who seemed willing to help did not have the authority to resolve my issue as there was no outcome and I ended up wasting several hours without any resolution in sight. \\n\\nThere was one supervisor in Chase travel department, which was probably being managed by XXXX, named XXXX, whom I ended up speaking with twice. During our brief conversation, She flatly refused to help me or answer any questions. She had the most condescending attitude that I have ever experienced from an agent affiliated with any company. She refused to give me an update or call XXXX. She refused to transfer me to her manager or anyone that could assist me. To top it all, she told me I needed a proof that I was related to the deceased which was contrary to what I had been told up till that point that all I needed was a death certificate. I called XXXX and according to them, a proof of relationship was not necessary or required. XXXX told me that it was their policy that all that was needed was a death certificate and Chase should have processed my credit as soon as they received it. \\n\\nIn XXXX, I emailed and I called Chase few times and each time I was promised that a supervisor would get back to me which never happened. One of the last representatives that that I spoke with was on XXXX, XXXX, who was from Chase benefits department. To my utter shock and surprise, he told me that they didn't have any type of claim for me on file. I was beyond hope at that point. He then transferred me once again to their travel department. The representative there told me that they were still waiting to hear from XXXX. I requested to speak with a supervisor and she told me it would be two hours before I could speak with one. She promised that a supervisor would call me back but as always, I never heard from anyone. \\n\\nAfter several weeks on the phone with Chase and after speaking to XXXX multiple times who repeatedly told me that the delay was from Chase, I finally decided that I would wait and see if the issue would be resolved. Today is XX/XX/XXXX and Chase has still not processed my credit and followed up or called back in response to any of my previous phone calls even when they promised that I would receive a phone call. \\n\\nI have finally decided that I am going to file a formal complaint with every private, state and federal consumer protection agency or organization. I would share my experience on any relevant online or offline forums available to me. I have been a great customer. I may have been frustrated with my experience but have always been respectful in my communications with Chase or its representatives. I have been managing my credit responsibly over the years, had several premium credit card offers as I had met their criteria to apply for their cards with similar benefits as Chase Sapphire. I decided to go with Chase and was hopeful that I would take advantage of their travel benefits. I spent thousands of dollars using my Chase card even though some of my other cards also offered attractive benefits. \\n\\nAs stated earlier, I fulfilled my obligation of using credit responsibly and of paying my bills. Chase on the other hand, failed to issue me a credit and fulfill its promise. A timely credit, under the circumstances, was my right. It was according to and within the rules set by both the Chase and XXXX Airlines. Unfortunately, I was never able to utilize the points that I had accumulated. A credit card company at the very least should treat every customer with respect, follow their own rules, keep their promises and follow up with their customers and if required and within the rules, be its customer 's adovocate on his or her behalf when dealing with third parties. I feel that Chase fell short of these basic standards and expectations. It with deep regret that I have to reconsider my business relationship with them. It is a shame that a well known company like Chase offering a premium card such as, Chase Sapphire and charging a $ XXXX yearly membership fee for it, would have such a poor service. It is either a case of extreme mismanagement by chase or a system deliberately designed in such a way that it only benefits the company at the expense of its customers.</td>\n",

The first claims specialist I spoke with was very rude. She kept badgering me about the final transaction on my account. When I couldn't provide her the information, she to call me back when I had the proper information and hung up. I called back and spoke with a guy named XXXX. I explained the situation to XXXX. He had me verify my last know transaction. After verifying my last known transaction, XXXX took a look at the claims made from XX/XX/XXXX. I advised XXXX that these were claims that I did not call in to reverse. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX This was the 2nd call I would make in 48 hours. The claim 's specialist, once again, was very rude.

I finally became frustrated and hung up. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX This was the 3rd attempt made to ( attempt to ) get help in recovering my money. To get any answers, I had to use a potential review to the XXXX XXXX XXXX about Chase 's claims practices and protocols. I was then transferred to Chase 's Executive Office to escalate my claim. It was at the Executive Office that I spoke with XXXX. XXXX opened Claim XXXX on my behalf. She said once my claim was assigned to an Executive Office employee, that person would contact me at the number on file. \\n\\nXXXX - Mid XXXX My case was assigned to XXXX in the Executive office. We spent roughly 2 weeks before either one of us spoke on the phone - although she had left a handful of voicemails. I first spoke with XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. I told her about the multiple claims that were opened against an account I had since closed. She claimed she only received two of the claims against the account. After speaking with me she assured me she was going to \" investigate '' all the claims made that were made beginning at the end of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed multiple payments being deducted from my Chase checking account. In the description, all I saw were numbers. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX to see why money was being debited from my account. Of course, all I got was XXXX 's voicemail. I left a message requesting a return call. By XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received a return call. I called XXXX once again because money was still being debited from my account. This time I got a hold of XXXX. Her explanation for the debited funds was a bit odd. She told me that while they were \" investigating '' these open claims, money was still going to be debited and there was nothing she could do about it. Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a voicemail from XXXX to call her as soon as possible. I returned her call once school was dismissed for the day. It was at that point, that XXXX told me they closed their \" investigation '' of my claims and decided not to reverse their decision. When asked what research they used to complete their \" investigation '' XXXX became short and told me I would have to subpoena the information. At that point, I hung up because I felt that it was a lose lose situation.</td>\n",

I used my debt card on Monday, XX/XX/2019 then tried to use it again but it would not work. I went to Chase bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity. I was shocked because I had not reported fraud on my account. I later found out that I was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I later contacted XXXX XXXX  XXXX again and was told that they DID see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within 3 - 5  days. I contacted the chase disputes department again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 2019 and explained thaXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would credit my account and that I did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim. The escalation manager did NOT care and told me that Chase decision on closing my account was final. I had been a customer of Chase for XXXX   years. My character has been challenged by the disputes agents and I consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander. \\n\\nI am NOT seeking to keep my account open with Chase BUT I also do NOT want Chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily. \\n\\nOnce again, I do NOT want Chase to have the checking account that I had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by Chase. \\n\\nI did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past.</td>\n",

I realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation, product, or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted Chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank. \\n\\nI contacted Chase via a secured message on XX/XX/2019 explaining what happened and asked \" Is there a way to reverse this transaction, or do you have a contact at XXXX that can give me more information about the recipient?

However, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction. I called XXXX again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. They told me that all of the information about the transaction would in Chase 's system because I used the banks app to perform the transaction. She stayed on the line with me until I understood everything that I should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. I ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nWhen I called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. She then asked me why I needed this information and I explained my situation again. I was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that I needed to contact XXXX to get the information I was looking for. After I told her that I had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. She said that Chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. In both phone calls, they asked if I initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, it felt like Chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. These transactions are advertised as a \" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business. I feel deceived by Chase 's advertising and further victimized by the way I was treated by the members on their customer service team.</td>\n",

The alert said that \" JPMCB Card Services '' had pulled my credit report ( another hard inquiry ). I immediately looked up JPMCB and it said it was a Chase company. I looked up customer service so I could find out what was going on and was told that no one is available in credit reporting on the weekends - only Monday- Friday. I was understandably upset as I had not applied anywhere on Saturday. What if someone was attempting to obtain credit under my name, I asked? I was told that they still couldn't help me since it was the weekend. What kind of company in this day and age of security breaches does not have someone available on the weekends? If credit is able to be pulled on the weekends, someone should be available on the weekends to assist should there be an issue.

cardmember services. \\nIn 2018 I wrote to Chase asking for debt verification and what they sent me a statement which is not acceptable. I am asking the bank to validate the debt. Instead I been receiving mail every month from them attempting to collect a debt. \\nI have a right to know this information as a consumer. \\n\\nChase account # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Thanks in advance for your help.   \n",

Morgan Chase restricted my account by my debit card Tuesday XX/XX/2019. On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

This situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont seem to want to deal with Me professionally. Thank you   \n",

                                          Chase sent me an email today with the innocuous title \" Important information regarding changes to your Chase account '' ( they often use similar titles for ads and other communications ). \\n\\nIn it, they force me into binding arbitration ( despite that never being something I had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them ). \\n\\nThey do include a method to opt out, but have no additional information about the consequences ( many other people I've seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that Chase will close their account if they opt out ) and, even more egregiously, despite Chase simply sending an email doing this, they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out. \\n\\nThis is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out. \\n\\nThis is blatant malpractice by Chase.   \n",

                                            I opened the saving account for the {$25.00} bonus. I was supposed to received the {$25.00} bonus after 3 consecutive auto transfers from checking to savings. I notice on XX/XX/2019 that automatic transfer was cancelled for not enough funds into my checking 's account. Therefore, I put enough funds in my account on XX/XX/2019 requested that the executive team reactivate my automatic transfer for the month of XXXX. Although Ms. XXXX reached out to me from the executive office, she failed to try to resolve my concerns ( case # XXXX ).   \n",

                           In XX/XX/2019, several transactions on my Chase checking account was fraudulent so I filed a report with Chase. Instead of helping me, Chase closed all my accounts and refused to have a banking relationship with me from then on. Then Chase froze all my money for a month and eventually sent me a balance after I had filed a complaint with CFPB. Now a month later, Chase tries to collect {$190.00} in debt that I have no idea where it came from. Chase said the balance was a result of a fraudulent transaction that Chase decided that I was responsible for.   \n",

bank on XXXX and used a code for XXXX bonus. I called to follow up on XX/XX/XXXX about the terms and was told everything was on the account and once I made XXXX direct deposit the bonus would be paid out in 10 days. As of XXXX I had made the required deposits and was told my account never had the coupon code applied and it was past the 21 days to do so, so no bonus would be paid.   \n",

months ago ), when I tried to access my Chase Ultimate Rewards account ( or even activate the 5 % bonus on Chase Freedom ), I would get shown this page that says \" We are unable to complete your request at this time '' ( image attached as well ) : XXXX : XXXX At first I thought it was just a temporary error ( which isn't uncommon for Chase ), but after 2 weeks this was still happening, so I called customer support. They opened a ticket, got escalated to their tech team, but when I would call back to find out what happened, they told me that the case had been closed. This happened 3 times, and each call has taken a lot of time to explain the situation and verify a bunch of information. \\n\\nGoing from ultimaterewards.com and chase.com have the  same result. \\n\\nI'm not able to use these points by phone either, because the operators for the Travel Center are not able to access my account/points neither. \\n\\nI've tried every browser, both XXXX and XXXX computers, and the XXXX Chase phone application. They all send me to the page that says \" We are unable to complete your request at this time '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I looked up some people that work in Ultimate Rewards on XXXX, and cold called a VP of Customer Relations. He acted like he was helpful at first, and we exchanged some emails. He eventually said I can buy a flight/hotel using Chase Sapphire and if I give him the details, he will deduct the appropriate points and credit my credit card for the purchase. \\n\\nLong story short, he wasn't able to fix anything. \\n\\nI can see that I'm still collecting points, but I haven't been able to access it. \\n\\nI travel a lot, and it's become a huge inconvenience that I'm not able to access these points which I intended to use for travel. I need to get this issue resolved ASAP.   \n",

                          I upgraded my XXXX XXXX card in XX/XX/2018 and was told by the agent who did the upgrade my anniversary date would not change. It turned the agent was giving me the wrong information in order to upgrade the account. XXXX   changed my anniversary date from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX without my consent! XXXX has the recording of the agent who was misled me.   \n",
       "94   I am writing you to file a complaint about an unresolved issue with my credit card chase and their benefit and travel departments. This has been my second travel related credit issue with chase. My first experience with chase was also about a credit that they were supposed to process. Chase was either unresponsive or slow. I finally ended up contacting the airlines directly and got a much quicker response and resolution from them. \\n\\nMy more recent issue with Chase has been my most stressful and frustrating experience when dealing with any credit card company or for that matter any other company that offers products or services. I am a Chase Sapphire card holder who has been using the card regularly for purchases amounting to hundreds or thousands of dollars every month. I have an excellent payment history with most of the bills paid in full every month. \\n\\n\\nIn XXXX  of 2019, I bought my XXXX airline ticket for an overseas trip through Chase using my accumulated Chase points. My father passed away overseas a week before my trip. I had to cancel my original trip and leave immediately so I called chase to cancel my ticket. Despite, under a lot of stress and in grief, I had to be on the phone with them for hours. I was put on long holds, transferred to different departments and still did not receive a definitive answer about cancelation of my trip and credit to my account. \\n\\n\\nAccording to the last customer representative that I spoke with that night, they had to send an email to a different department and that I could follow up with them the following week by Tuesday or Wednesday as they would have processed my cancelation by then. Unfortunately, It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to be calling from overseas and be on the phone with the credit card company for hours. I had to authorize my husband to follow up on my behalf the following week before his upcoming trip overseas as he had to leave on XX/XX/XXXX, which was our original plan. \\n\\n\\nMy husband called them few times and went through the same process of being on the phone for hours either being on hold or being transferred to different departments. He spoke with the main customer service, the benefits and the chase travel. Initially, a representative advised him to contact XXXX  directly to cancel my ticket. Finally, after further research, the same representative that he spoke to in the benefit department told him that we should expect to receive a credit because of the death in the family, The representative assigned us a case number and told my husband that Chase would get the refund from XXXX on our behalf. According to him, all we needed was a death certificate. Since we were both expected to be out of the country for few weeks, the representative told my husband that the credit could be processed anytime upon our return or soon after the Chase received the death certificate from us. \\n\\nIn XXXX, while still overseas, I received an e-mail on XXXX, XXXX from XXXX in Chase travel who was following up with the death certificate. I e-mailed Chase travel department the scanned copy of the death certificate as soon as it became available to me. I even e-mailed them a translation of the death certificate which was neither required by Chase or XXXX. I sent it to XXXX who had contacted me on XXXX, XXXX by responding to her e-mail from XXXX, XXXX and then forwarded it again to her to make sure that they received it. For personal and family reasons, I ended up staying a little longer than expected and retuned to the United States on XXXX. There was still no acknowledgment from XXXX or anyone from Chase Travel or any other department acknowledging the receipt of my e-mail from XXXX or any other update. Soon after my return, I had to send the travel department my father 's death certificate for the third time and even tried to follow up with a phone call. I also tried to send them an e-mail on XX/XX/XXXX, expressing my disappointment and requesting an update. I also tried to correspond with Chase customer service and Chase travel through my online chase account. \\n\\nChase travel finally responded with an acknowledgement through an e-mail that they had received and located the death certificate that I had sent them. The e-mail was from XXXX, one of the Travel consultant supervisor for chase travel. According to her, they had forwarded the death certificate to XXXX. She apologized for my experience with them and also asked me to disregard any other emails from them requesting documentation. During this whole ordeal with Chase, I had contacted XXXX numerous times and spoke to different representatives. According to XXXX, In order for Chase to process my credit, they didn't need to forward the death certificate to XXXX. \\n\\nIn one of my initials calls to Chase after my return to the United States, I found out that the case number / reference number assigned to us and given to my husband by the by chase benefits department in XXXX could not be used as a reference because I was told that it did not exist in their system. In XXXX and XXXX, I spoke to several people and few supervisors hoping that they could resolve my issue. Customer service agents who seemed willing to help did not have the authority to resolve my issue as there was no outcome and I ended up wasting several hours without any resolution in sight. \\n\\nThere was one supervisor in Chase travel department, which was probably being managed by XXXX, named XXXX, whom I ended up speaking with twice. During our brief conversation, She flatly refused to help me or answer any questions. She had the most condescending attitude that I have ever experienced from an agent affiliated with any company. She refused to give me an update or call XXXX. She refused to transfer me to her manager or anyone that could assist me. To top it all, she told me I needed a proof that I was related to the deceased which was contrary to what I had been told up till that point that all I needed was a death certificate. I called XXXX and according to them, a proof of relationship was not necessary or required. XXXX told me that it was their policy that all that was needed was a death certificate and Chase should have processed my credit as soon as they received it. \\n\\nIn XXXX, I emailed and I called Chase few times and each time I was promised that a supervisor would get back to me which never happened. One of the last representatives that that I spoke with was on XXXX, XXXX, who was from Chase benefits department. To my utter shock and surprise, he told me that they didn't have any type of claim for me on file. I was beyond hope at that point. He then transferred me once again to their travel department. The representative there told me that they were still waiting to hear from XXXX. I requested to speak with a supervisor and she told me it would be two hours before I could speak with one. She promised that a supervisor would call me back but as always, I never heard from anyone. \\n\\nAfter several weeks on the phone with Chase and after speaking to XXXX multiple times who repeatedly told me that the delay was from Chase, I finally decided that I would wait and see if the issue would be resolved. Today is XX/XX/XXXX and Chase has still not processed my credit and followed up or called back in response to any of my previous phone calls even when they promised that I would receive a phone call. \\n\\nI have finally decided that I am going to file a formal complaint with every private, state and federal consumer protection agency or organization. I would share my experience on any relevant online or offline forums available to me. I have been a great customer. I may have been frustrated with my experience but have always been respectful in my communications with Chase or its representatives. I have been managing my credit responsibly over the years, had several premium credit card offers as I had met their criteria to apply for their cards with similar benefits as Chase Sapphire. I decided to go with Chase and was hopeful that I would take advantage of their travel benefits. I spent thousands of dollars using my Chase card even though some of my other cards also offered attractive benefits. \\n\\nAs stated earlier, I fulfilled my obligation of using credit responsibly and of paying my bills. Chase on the other hand, failed to issue me a credit and fulfill its promise. A timely credit, under the circumstances, was my right. It was according to and within the rules set by both the Chase and XXXX Airlines. Unfortunately, I was never able to utilize the points that I had accumulated. A credit card company at the very least should treat every customer with respect, follow their own rules, keep their promises and follow up with their customers and if required and within the rules, be its customer 's adovocate on his or her behalf when dealing with third parties. I feel that Chase fell short of these basic standards and expectations. It with deep regret that I have to reconsider my business relationship with them. It is a shame that a well known company like Chase offering a premium card such as, Chase Sapphire and charging a $ XXXX yearly membership fee for it, would have such a poor service. It is either a case of extreme mismanagement by chase or a system deliberately designed in such a way that it only benefits the company at the expense of its customers.   \n",

                                            On XX/XX/2019 we purchased a service with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( also known as XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX by XXXX XXXX ) for our group of 23 people to go to various islands and snorkeling activities out of XXXX. The bases of the dispute is that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX took us to 1 island only and did not follow thru with the itinerary that had been planned out. Most of the conversation was over the phone. At the end of the day with much confusion XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX charged my card {$4400.00} for services NOT rendered. This is the cause of the dispute. I tried dealing with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they were not budging on refunding us partial payment due to not following the itinerary that had been planned. So I then went to my Credit Card Chase Sapphire Dispute Department to resolve the issue. After many, many phone calls and months of dealing with this dispute, our Credit Card has sided with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX word over ours on what went on that day. Basically XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has continuously lied about the events that day and even said they gave us a credit which was also another lie. I have spent so much time on this and can not believe that we as customers with a very good history have to deal with our Credit Card on this level. \\n\\nThere was another large group lead by XXXX XXXX on this excursion who also felt they were not given what was promised. That group also disputed the charges and was refunded the money by their Credit Card company. \\n\\nOn the attached PDF pages 12 -14 give details of what went wrong that day.   \n",

                 My chase amazon card was declined for a catering order I had placed for my brothers funeral in the amount of {$710.00}. I contacted chase around noon today XX/XX/2019 and was asked the last 4 numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account. I responded that I did not have a savings and I am only authorized user. Customer rep told me they would call me back in 10 minutes to keep the line open. I didnt receive a call back after an hour so I contacted chase. From the first call I thought someone was using my card fraudulently. I spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor XXXX who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. Called the catering company and card was declined. I then used my XXXX  XXXX card to pay for the order. XXXX XXXX texted me asking if I was authorizing purchase and I responded yes. Contacted caterer and XXXX  XXXX was declined. I contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed. Went to use chase amazon at restaurant at XXXX pm tonight in the amount of {$63.00} - it was declined. I was told by chase I was not over limit. Still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use. Embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting I was over my limit which I pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that I was under my limit with the {$710.00} transaction. Never been declined by either chase or XXXX  XXXX before - today after multiple assurances that I was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear - it never did   \n",

pretending to be me and withdrawing money from my account. He admitted that he figured out my pin because it happens to be the same as my phone password. \\n\\nHe also admitted that he would sneak into my room while I was sleeping and put the card back before I woke up. \\n\\nHe apologized but says he spent the money. I tried to dispute this with Chase but they claim that since my debit card PIN number was used that they cant prove it wasnt me. \\n\\nAlthough they advertise that I have 100 % Fraud Protection they refuse to give me my money back. \\n\\nATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$200.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$200.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$280.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$240.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$2500.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$980.00}   \n",

At the time I was verbally told that the offer was XXXX rapid reward points and a companion pass after spending $ XXXX in the first three months. I followed a link provided to open the credit card. Now they are saying that the offer was over at the time and they have given me a much less valuable sign-up promotion that doesn't include the companion pass. The companion pass was the entire reason we signed-up and the reason the card was promoted to me. They have informed me that the offer was from Jan 10-Feb 11 and that my cc shows approval on the XXXX XXXX. The supervisor I spoke to said that they specifically don't send out offer details to confirm your offer when you sign up ( thus denying me evidence ) but also that they can't fix it without this evidence. I feel that their offer and subsequent actions are fraudulent and constitute deceptive practices. When I spoke to XXXX, they acknowledged that it doesn't seem right but stated that Chase is the one who has to authorize the deals so the error was definitely on their end.   \n",

Be careful - the marketing is not clear. IF you already have a SWA Chase personal card, do not apply for the new one online. This has sent me through a XXXX triangle, wasting my time and therefore money. \\n\\nIt appears in the middle of XX/XX/2018, Chase expanded their undisclosed 5/24 rule to include ALL co-branded cards, not just SWA, yet the marketing machine continues to ignore this policy and the Agents on the phone are not well trained. I am contacting the credit bureau b/c two of the cards opened are not mine - that is the silver lining here. \\n\\nHowever, the issue with incessant marketing of their branded cards to customers, plus this confusing 5/24 rule and lack of Agent phone training, is false advertising. The information is still relatively opaque, as Chase never comments on the 5/24 rule, but multiple reader and community data points suggest denials due to 5/24 for cards previously exempt. \\n\\nCFPB staff, please help educate consumers and hold the big banks accountable for deceptive trade practices. I do not believe this is intentional on Chase 's part, but the second to last Agent did encourage me to file a complaint here, so be it. \\n\\nThank you! \\n\\nXXXX   \n",

account. This happened back in 2013. Though I have made numerous attempts to contact them, they do not respond and they tell me know one works in that department any more so there is no one to contact. Because of this, instead of saying sold on my credit report it shows that I am very behind on payments and it is hurting my credit. I have called them and mailed letter, and no response.   \n",

the summer months, I experience a decline income due to my employment. Therefore, I request a one month payment extension with my Auto Loan Company, Chase. For the past almost fours years, my request for payment extension is granted. I have never been delinquent with my auto loan payment. However, On XX/XX/2019 my request for a one month payment extension was denied this year. I explained my situation to representative and the supervisor with no avail. After a lengthy discussion and waiting, I was informed the reason for the decline as it is not \" contractual ''. This reason for denial baffled me and therefore I emailed the office of XXXX XXXX Executive Director, Communications, JPMorgan Chase & Co. A representative contacted me and stated Chase will follow-up. About week later a representative of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office called. The representative shared her role was help resolve the matter. The representative via conference call contacted the department handing my request. After, reviewing my information my request was still denied based on \" policy changes ''. I requested an explanation and representative stated a letter will be mailed with explanation. I have received XXXX letters the reason for denial was not \" policy changes ''. I would like CFPB help in exploring the denial of my payment extension request especially since I have been clear reason for denial.   \n",

I made payments of {$160.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$260.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The minimum payment was {$140.00}. The closing date was XX/XX/XXXX ( please see attached statement ). That statement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) shows that I had an outstanding purchase balance of {$230.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were NO other purchases prior to the one on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nHowever, when I got the XXXX statement, it shows that I still have a purchase balance of {$210.00}. I have a promotional balance (@XXXX ) in XXXX of {$6900.00}. In XXXX, the promotional balance was {$7200.00} - a difference of {$380.00}. \\n\\nApparently, the payment ( above the minimum payment required by Chase ) I thought would be applied to the purchase (@ 21.49 % ) was applied to the promotional balance first. It is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met, payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first. This is not the first time that Chase has skirted US Financial Law to turn a larger profit. I need help in rectifying this problem, because my logic fell on deaf ears at Chase. Thank you in advance for your assistance. \\n\\nRespectfully, XXXX XXXX XXXX   \n",

Finally, a payment was reversed from XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$230.00}. \\nXX/XX/XXXX Claim # : XXXX I made a claim in the branch that was advised by a customer service representative. \\nThis advice was made when I went to close out an account after receiving a phishing email. It was then found that my debit card had been use to make multiple transactions totaling {$2800.00} between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Actions I Have Personally Taken To Resolve The Issue XX/XX/XXXX After beginning to receive claims paperwork, I immediately notified Chase claims department. The first claims specialist I spoke with was very rude. She kept badgering me about the final transaction on my account. When I couldn't provide her the information, she to call me back when I had the proper information and hung up. I called back and spoke with a guy named XXXX. I explained the situation to XXXX. He had me verify my last know transaction. After verifying my last known transaction, XXXX took a look at the claims made from XX/XX/XXXX. I advised XXXX that these were claims that I did not call in to reverse. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX This was the 2nd call I would make in 48 hours. The claim 's specialist, once again, was very rude. When I called back, I told the claim 's specialist I would like to speak to a supervisor. I was put on hold for 15 minutes. I finally became frustrated and hung up. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX This was the 3rd attempt made to ( attempt to ) get help in recovering my money. To get any answers, I had to use a potential review to the XXXX XXXX XXXX about Chase 's claims practices and protocols. I was then transferred to Chase 's Executive Office to escalate my claim. It was at the Executive Office that I spoke with XXXX. XXXX opened Claim XXXX on my behalf. She said once my claim was assigned to an Executive Office employee, that person would contact me at the number on file. \\n\\nXXXX - Mid XXXX My case was assigned to XXXX in the Executive office. We spent roughly 2 weeks before either one of us spoke on the phone - although she had left a handful of voicemails. I first spoke with XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. I told her about the multiple claims that were opened against an account I had since closed. She claimed she only received two of the claims against the account. After speaking with me she assured me she was going to \" investigate '' all the claims made that were made beginning at the end of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed multiple payments being deducted from my Chase checking account. In the description, all I saw were numbers. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX to see why money was being debited from my account. Of course, all I got was XXXX 's voicemail. I left a message requesting a return call. By XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received a return call. I called XXXX once again because money was still being debited from my account. This time I got a hold of XXXX. Her explanation for the debited funds was a bit odd. She told me that while they were \" investigating '' these open claims, money was still going to be debited and there was nothing she could do about it. Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a voicemail from XXXX to call her as soon as possible. I returned her call once school was dismissed for the day. It was at that point, that XXXX told me they closed their \" investigation '' of my claims and decided not to reverse their decision. When asked what research they used to complete their \" investigation '' XXXX became short and told me I would have to subpoena the information. At that point, I hung up because I felt that it was a lose lose situation.   \n",

the XXXX. Chase Auto Finance is refusing to pay on the GAP insurance/waiver coverage that I purchased at the time I signed the financing agreement. While stationed at XXXX I purchased a XXXX Cadillac ATS Premium and financed the vehicle with Chase Auto Finance. When I purchased the vehicle the original financing agreement included an option to purchase GAP insurance for an additional {$690.00}. The provider of the GAP insurance was \" XXXX XXXX '' however I was also required to sign a GAP Waiver Addendum which stated that what was purchased was not insurance, but an agreement for Chase Auto Finance to Waive any deficiency in the event the vehicle was totaled. Chase Auto Finance agreed in writing for me to ship my vehicle to XXXX when I received military orders re-assigning me to XXXX. The letter explicitly authorized me to drive the vehicle here in XXXX while I am stationed overseas. The vehicle was totaled in an accident. Now Chase is refusing to honor the GAP insurance/waiver provisions because the loss occurred outside of the United States or XXXX. They are also refusing to release the lien on the vehicle so that the salvage value can be recovered and sent to the bank. I simply want Chase Bank to honor its commitment to cover the deficiency between the insurance payout and the remaining balance on the loan ( {$1300.00} if the salvage value of {$8000.00} is paid ).   \n",

I have missed a payment in XX/XX/2018 and was 30 days past due but now current. I applied numerous times for a loan modification to get loss mitigation assistance but did not get any help. Chase only gave me a loan forbearance option. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and have an issue with refinancing since my DTI is too high because of excessive debt so I get declined every time and my credit score is too low at XXXX.   \n",

                                I have wired through one of Chase branches in XXXX XXXX, the exact Reinstatement Amount of {$43000.00} to JPMorgan Chase Bank In order to remove/withdraw their wrongful foreclosure proceedings on my residential property.\\n\\nHowever, the Chase Executive Ms. XXXX XXXX, and it's trustee, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are not honoring even their own rules and regulations, she wants the Total Payoff of {$100000.00} now in order to remove their wrongful foreclosure proceedings with Sales Date of XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX on my family resident.\\n\\nShe knows I can not prepare XXXX in such a short time. That's why I asked for minimum reinstatement amount to avoid foreclosure without resorting to Chapter XXXX- bankruptcy filing.\\n\\nI appreciate you assistant in bringing JPMorgan Chase and it's foreclosure trustee, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \" Quality '' to their senses, and stop harassing my family with their fraudulent default claim as explained in my previous complaint about them on XX/XX/XXXX.\\n\\nMy previous complaint ID is.

in XXXX. \\nI paid the loan in XX/XX/XXXXbut chase financial never release the title. \\nI contacted chase several time with no resolution. Each time they told me they will release it but nothing was done. \\nNow I moved to another state and I can not get the registration in the other state because I do not have the title. \\nI will be obliged to rent a car since I can not use my car   \n",

      I recently called to ask Chase bank why they reported to the credit Bureau that I was 30 days late on a payment that was already paid off. When I called I got this info : They showed that on the XXXX of XX/XX/2019 I was very late on my bill and owed XXXX to bring this balance down to XXXX and be finished with the bill. I paid that amount on the same day the XXXX to being it to XXXX. \\n\\nTHey say that I tried to make another payment for {$250.00} later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment. \\n\\nThe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that I had a credit on my account for XXXX since I didnt owe anything. \\n\\nThey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that I had no idea of since I thought I paid off the entire amount. They reported to the credit Bureau that I was 30 days late for not paying what accrued to be {$56.00} The guy representing Chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them. I still have {$2.00} in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app. \\n\\nAdditionally, because they reported me being late my credit score dropped 51 points. When I called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said I would have to do that on my own. I think that's XXXX.   \n",

dollar but the I realize it was the wrong airport so I called right away to cancel the ticket and since it was before 24 hours so I could cancel it and get a refund which is what supposed to post in my account in 5 days and on XX/XX/XXXX I got the money back so I purchase another airline ticket with the same money that I got back but it was XXXX dollar and the money was taking out of my available balance on XX/XX/XXXX but it was saying pending on the statement but it was out of my available balance already on XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX dollar Was taking again out of my account but showing in my account as it was only one charge .. and I am not even able to see the first airline ticket or the refund on my statement because they said it was dropped charge like it was never happened but it did happened..thats not the first time this happened it did happened before but I usually get the money back after the weekend on Monday but this time no it did got back .. I tried calling them and they explaining but they only say one thing.. I dont see it on the statement.. so why I cant see my purchase for the first airline ticket that it was refunded.. this is my money and I am supposed to see all the charges I made and the refund on my account.. I am missing XXXX dollar from my account which is got Disappeared from my bank account and I need to get this money back I dont know what to do   \n",

                                                   This complaint is a follow up regarding a complaint # XXXX filed on cfpb. \\n\\nThe original complaint was regarding a dispute detailed below. \\n\\nMy laptop was stolen last year and someone used my information to book two flights from two different cities headed to the same destination. I immediately disputed the transactions as soon as i got a notification.i filed the complaint within an hour of getting notification that flights have been booked on my credit card. chase was extremely slow to respond and didnt do due diligence and contact the airline right away to cancel the flight and get me a refund. \\nChase did a very poor job at investigating the incident and put the charges back on my credit card without doing a proper investigation. when i asked, i was told that i benefited from the transactions. Clearly, i couldnt have flown from two different cities to the same destination. later, the airline also confirmed that i never took benefited from those flights. chase asked me for a bunch of documents and i provided all the documents including the police report for the stolen laptop, proof that the flights were booked under my name. however, the date of births used to book the flights were not mine. Clearly, i couldnt have benefited from the services even if i wanted to. \\nThe way chase handled the dispute was extremely poor and after multiple bad experiences and inability of chase to resolve disputes, i am pretty positive that chase is horrible at resolving disputes. \\nI am over that but this complaint i am filing is NOT about the original claim.Please read below about this complaint. \\n\\nPLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY! \\n\\nAfter this incident, i contacted XXXX and inquired about the flight. They told me that they found too bookings for the same person headed to the same destination from two destinations and cancelled one of the bookings and issued a refund. Chase has NOT contacted XXXX ONCE to resolve this issue. XXXX has confirmed several times that they have issued me a refund and the money has been transferred to my bank account. However, chase hasnt issued me a refund. Whenever i contact chase, they give me same old response. the case has been closed. I am not opening the same claim. Its a new complaint. XXXX has issued me a refund and it hasnt been given to me by chase. XXXX 's customer service can not connect me to the accounting team and therefore it not possible for me to find the transaction and details.This is chase banks job! connect with them and find out whats going on. Instead chase is asking me to contact XXXX and prove that the refund has been issued. XXXX is telling me to have my bank contact their accounting department because its a banks job to resolve this issues.Now, i am filing a new complaint demanding my money with interest and all the time chase has wasted. \\nI am attaching the documents that XXXX has provided me. Chase has asked me to provide these documents. Its chase 's job but i am doing this ob their behalf. \\n\\nXXXX is clearly stating that the bank has the funds. They have also provided me a document showing that transaction details that the refund was applied to my account. \\n\\nPlease issue me a refund. I have done everything i could have. Please, DO NOT close my complaint without issuing me a refund that XXXX has issued a long time ago! \\nEnough is enough!   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                          I pre-ordered an item on XX/XX/XXXX and paid {$350.00} with a Chase credit card. The merchant, XXXX XXXX, gave an estimated product shipment date of \" XX/XX/XXXX. '' After waiting for this item for a significant amount of time, I decided to cancel the order as it did not appear that the item would ever be completed and shipped. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a refund from the merchant, XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant stated that my order was cancelled, and the refund would return to the original method of payment in five business days. The original method of payment was a Chase credit card that I had since closed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a secure message to Chase requesting that the refund be transferred to one of my open Chase cards. I also followed up with a phone call that same week, and the representative I spoke to informed me that funds that are sent to closed accounts would be sent via check through the mail and could not be transferred to any existing accounts. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase indicating that my \" disputed charge '' would remain on my account and \" the merchant is not willing to credit your account. '' I followed up with a phone call to Chase describing that this was a refund, not a dispute. The representative informed me that they did not have access to closed accounts. I explained my previous attempts via phone and message to locate these funds. They informed me to try to send a secure message again this time emphasizing that the refund I am looking for is on a closed account and that the previous representative may have looked for the refund on a different account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent another secure message with this information as well as the emails I received from the merchant about the refund ( see Attachment ).  On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase with similar language about \" the merchant is not willing to credit your account '' and \" we consider the charge valid based on the results of our research '' ( see Attachment ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up with the merchant, XXXX XXXX, requesting an alternate way to receive this refund given that my credit card company apparently can not locate the funds. On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant provided a screenshot with their records that the funds had been refunded ( see Attachment ). This was my last exchange trying to resolve this between the credit card or the merchant.   \n",

            To whom it may concern, Chase bank charged wrongly overdraft fees, I have alert of low balance or unsuficent fee balance and always deposit immediatly to cover transactions if needed but Chase always changed the order and charged me overdraft fee anyway. when you call they said their per their guidelines they don't refund more then 2 overdrawft doesn't matter bank fault or not.\\n\\nTaken {$34.00} from people is money just because you can is not Ok.\\n\\nSee attached documents. When Chase refund, they always find the way to take back what they refunded in first place.   \n",

I was charged but never received the service. I was supposed to receive a refund back to my card but it never happened. My account has since been closed and I'm out of almost {$2000.00}.   \n",

                                                               I made a purchase with XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$38.00}. I was charged twice for this transaction. I placed a disputes case with Chase bank on XX/XX/2019 when I noticed the charge on my account. I called back on Sunday, XX/XX/2019 about the provisional credit for the charge and again on Monday, XX/XX/2019. I was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided. I used my debt card on Monday, XX/XX/2019 then tried to use it again but it would not work. I went to Chase bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity. I was shocked because I had not reported fraud on my account. I later found out that I was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I later contacted XXXX XXXX  XXXX again and was told that they DID see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within 3 - 5  days. I contacted the chase disputes department again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 2019 and explained thaXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would credit my account and that I did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim. The escalation manager did NOT care and told me that Chase decision on closing my account was final. I had been a customer of Chase for XXXX   years. My character has been challenged by the disputes agents and I consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander. \\n\\nI am NOT seeking to keep my account open with Chase BUT I also do NOT want Chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily. \\n\\nOnce again, I do NOT want Chase to have the checking account that I had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by Chase. \\n\\nI did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past.   \n",

                                                       My Dispute is for not receiving services listed below : -- One Night at the Hotel in XXXX {$730.00} for Friday XX/XX/2018. \\n-- Transportation to the Hotel {$170.00} for Friday XX/XX/2018. \\n-- Private City Tour of XXXX {$220.00} for Friday XX/XX/2018. \\n-- XXXX XXXX Private Tour {$150.00} for Friday XX/XX/2018. \\nGrand Total of {$1200.00} Reason for not receiving the services was that XXXX cancelled the flight from XXXX to XXXX for mechanical reasons. \\nI started the process for the of the refund thru XXXX XXXX, I was told by XXXX XXXX that I needed to request the refund thru XXXX, which I did, I requested the refund and was told by XXXX that since i didn't purchase the ticket directly thru them but it was done thru a 3rd party I needed to go thru XXXX XXXX, I went back to them and was told that they will not refund me. \\nI then started a dispute with my credit card Chase Visa for the charges, the Credit Card Dispute Department closed my dispute saying that the vendor stated that I did receive the services which is not true but my Credit card closed the dispute after several attempts by me to reopen the dispute.   \n",

                                                On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I made a {$300.00} payment to an online retailer using Chase quick pay with XXXX on the Chase website. I realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation, product, or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted Chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank. \\n\\nI contacted Chase via a secured message on XX/XX/2019 explaining what happened and asked \" Is there a way to reverse this transaction, or do you have a contact at XXXX that can give me more information about the recipient? '' That XXXX, my message was reviewed and I received a response restating my original email and informing me that \" The transfer has been completed. However, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction. I called XXXX again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. They told me that all of the information about the transaction would in Chase 's system because I used the banks app to perform the transaction. She stayed on the line with me until I understood everything that I should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. I ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nWhen I called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. She then asked me why I needed this information and I explained my situation again. I was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that I needed to contact XXXX to get the information I was looking for. After I told her that I had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. She said that Chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. In both phone calls, they asked if I initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, it felt like Chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. These transactions are advertised as a \" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business. I feel deceived by Chase 's advertising and further victimized by the way I was treated by the members on their customer service team.   \n",

towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

with all three reporting company 12 times and they are not fixing my problem so I have started lawsuits on all three so now I'm disputing direct with you I found a lot of FCRA violation on account XXXX first violation is fcra 623 & 806 B you are not entering the consumer dispute marks on none of the reports after you have verified this account The law states that a creditor must Must enter this information because it CAN NOT REPORT ON THE CONSUMER REPORT. this is a violation of the FCRA you could be sued {$1000.00} per bureau. violation number two you stated that this account has been closed but you are still reporting a monthly payment this is also a violation of the FCRA another {$1000.00} per bureau. so please delete this account asap due to the violation of the fcra The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA. chase DO NOT TAKE THIS AS A THREAT BUT I'm sick of dealing with the credit reporting company I'm taking action one down and two more court dates coming up here very soon   \n",

account with Amazon and was denied credit. I subscribe to XXXX credit reporting services,, so I was notified immediately that a hard inquiry had taken place by \" Chase Card '' and that the company had pulled my credit report. Okay, so I understand that. This was on Friday, XX/XX/2019. I did not apply for credit following that. Imagine my surprise when I got another alert on Saturday afternoon, XX/XX/2019. The alert said that \" JPMCB Card Services '' had pulled my credit report ( another hard inquiry ). I immediately looked up JPMCB and it said it was a Chase company. I looked up customer service so I could find out what was going on and was told that no one is available in credit reporting on the weekends - only Monday- Friday. I was understandably upset as I had not applied anywhere on Saturday. What if someone was attempting to obtain credit under my name, I asked? I was told that they still couldn't help me since it was the weekend. What kind of company in this day and age of security breaches does not have someone available on the weekends? If credit is able to be pulled on the weekends, someone should be available on the weekends to assist should there be an issue. I still have no resolution nor any indication of why my credit would be pulled when I did not ask for it to be, particularly when it was an additional hard inquiry and I do not have an account with Chase.   \n",

                              I have reached out to XXXX several times in attempt to have this fraudulent inquiry removed I was told that I need to call and contact the original creditor that placed this inquiry on my report. I have made several attempts to get chase bank to contact the bureau and remove this inquiry that was not authorized by me. They seem to not be able to get me to the right person to take care of this issue no matter how many attempts I have made nobody seems to understand what I'm talkin about. I want chase bank to have this fraudulent inquiry removed from my credit report before I take legal action. I I have never requested any kind of credit with chase bank or hold any account with them. I have an iquiry from XX/XX/2019. I want this matter resolved.   \n",
